# ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-SALES-ADOPTION-PREDICTION-ML-PROJECT-
A Machine Learning project that analyzes global Electric Vehicle (EV) sales and adoption trends, predicts future EV sales, and classifies countries based on adoption levels using real-world data and predictive modeling.

# Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts Electric Vehicle (EV) sales and adoption patterns using Machine Learning and Data Analytics.

It combines:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize EV trends
2. Regression Models to forecast future EV sales
3. Classification Models to categorize countries by EV adoption levels

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The rapid expansion of the Electric Vehicle (EV) market has made it essential to analyze sales data and forecast future adoption rates.
However, identifying which factors drive adoption and predicting sales trends across regions remain challenging.
This project aims to:
  Analyze EV sales and adoption trends globally.
  Predict future EV sales using ML regression models.
  Classify countries into adoption categories (high, medium, low).
 
# Objectives
Study the global growth of EVs using historical data
1. Forecast future EV sales using ML regression models
2. Classify countries as High, Medium, or Low EV adopters
3. Identify major factors influencing EV adoption
